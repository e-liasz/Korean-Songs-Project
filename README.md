# Korean-Songs-Project

A small scale project based on learning how to use computational analysis methods for the Computational Literacy course. The goal of the project is to find out themes in popular South Korean pop songs and analyzing whether there is a link between songs winning or losing the Song Of The Year award and the words they contain.
